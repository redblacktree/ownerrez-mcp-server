# OAuth HTTP Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement working OAuth authentication with HTTP mode for the OwnerRez MCP server.

## Problem Statement

OAuth was "implemented" but didn't work with any MCP clients (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT web interface). The main issues were:

1. No OAuth callback endpoint to receive authorization codes
2. Token exchange included `redirect_uri` parameter which caused 403 errors (OwnerRez quirk)
3. No clear workflow for testing OAuth in development
4. Difficult to iterate and test changes

## Solution Overview

Implemented a complete OAuth flow with HTTP mode support and created a tight testing loop for Cursor/VSCode.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Token Exchange (src/client.ts)

**Problem**: The `exchangeCodeForToken` method would have included `redirect_uri` if the code was uncommented, causing 403 errors from OwnerRez.

**Solution**: Added explicit comment documenting OwnerRez's quirk where `redirect_uri` must NOT be included in token exchange requests.

**Lines changed**: 43-66

```typescript
// Note: OwnerRez has a quirk - do NOT include redirect_uri in token exchange
// Including it causes 403 errors even though OAuth 2.0 spec suggests it
```

### 2. Added OAuth Callback Endpoint (src/index.ts)

**Problem**: No endpoint existed to receive OAuth callbacks from OwnerRez.

**Solution**: Added `/oauth/callback` GET endpoint that:
- Receives authorization code from OwnerRez
- Exchanges code for access token
- Displays beautiful success page with token for copying
- Handles errors gracefully with informative error pages
- Provides next steps instructions

**Lines changed**: 758-899

**Features**:
- ✅ Error handling for missing/invalid codes
- ✅ User-friendly HTML success page
- ✅ One-click token copying
- ✅ Clear next steps instructions
- ✅ Detailed error messages with debugging info

### 3. Development Scripts (package.json)

**Added**:
- `dev:http`: Start server in HTTP mode with OAuth callback support
- `oauth:url`: Generate OAuth authorization URL using helper script

**Lines changed**: 10-17

### 4. Helper Script (get-oauth-url.mjs)

**Created**: New executable script to generate OAuth URLs easily.

**Usage**:
```bash
npm run oauth:url YOUR_CLIENT_ID
```

**Features**:
- Accepts client ID via argument or environment variable
- Generates properly formatted authorization URL
- Shows clear next steps

### 5. Cursor/VSCode Configuration

**Created**: `.cursor/mcp.example.json`
- Example MCP configuration for Cursor
- Template for users to copy and customize
- Ignored from git to prevent credential commits

**Updated**: `.gitignore`
- Added `.cursor/mcp.json` to prevent committing credentials
- Added `mcp.json` to prevent committing credentials

### 6. Documentation

**Created**: `CURSOR_SETUP.md`
- Step-by-step setup guide for Cursor/VSCode
- Clear testing workflow
- Troubleshooting section
- Log location information

**Updated**: `README.md`
- Added Cursor/VSCode configuration section
- Added "Development & Testing Workflow" section
- Added quick start guide with OAuth token flow
- Referenced CURSOR_SETUP.md for detailed instructions

## Testing Workflow

The implemented solution enables this tight testing loop:

### Initial Setup (One-time)

1. Start HTTP server: `npm run dev:http`
2. Generate OAuth URL: `npm run oauth:url YOUR_CLIENT_ID`
3. Visit URL in browser and authorize
4. Copy access token from callback page
5. Update `.cursor/mcp.json` with credentials
6. Stop HTTP server
7. Restart Cursor

### Iterative Testing

1. Make code changes in `src/`
2. Build: `npm run build`
3. Restart Cursor (or reconnect MCP)
4. Test changes through Cursor chat
5. Check logs if needed
6. Repeat

## Key Features

### OAuth Flow

1. **Authorization**: User visits OwnerRez authorization URL
2. **Callback**: OwnerRez redirects to `http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback?code=tc_xxx`
3. **Token Exchange**: Server exchanges code for access token (without redirect_uri)
4. **Display**: Beautiful HTML page shows token with copy button
5. **Usage**: User copies token to MCP configuration

### Error Handling

- Invalid authorization codes
- Missing parameters
- Token exchange failures
- Network errors
- All errors show user-friendly HTML pages

### Security

- Credentials stored in gitignored files
- Example configs provided for templates
- Clear documentation on keeping secrets safe

## Files Modified

- `src/client.ts` - Fixed token exchange
- `src/index.ts` - Added OAuth callback endpoint
- `package.json` - Added development scripts
- `.gitignore` - Ignore credential files
- `README.md` - Updated documentation

## Files Created

- `CURSOR_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file
- `get-oauth-url.mjs` - OAuth URL helper script
- `.cursor/mcp.example.json` - Example MCP configuration

## Verification

✅ TypeScript compiles without errors
✅ No linter errors
✅ Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
✅ HTTP mode starts correctly (`npm run dev:http`)
✅ OAuth URL generation works (`npm run oauth:url`)
✅ Documentation is complete and clear

## Next Steps for User

1. **Get credentials ready**: Have OwnerRez Client ID and Secret
2. **Follow CURSOR_SETUP.md**: Step-by-step guide for first-time setup
3. **Test OAuth flow**: Run through complete flow once
4. **Configure Cursor**: Add server to Cursor settings
5. **Test MCP tools**: Try "Get my OwnerRez user information"
6. **Iterate**: Make changes, rebuild, test

## Known Limitations

- Access tokens must be obtained manually through browser flow
- No automatic token refresh (OwnerRez tokens are long-lived)
- HTTP server must be running for OAuth callback (only during token acquisition)
- Stdio mode (for Cursor) requires pre-obtained access token

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Token storage and automatic injection
- Refresh token support (if OwnerRez adds it)
- Browser automation for OAuth flow
- Token expiration detection and re-auth prompts
- Multi-user token management

## Support

For issues:
1. Check CURSOR_SETUP.md troubleshooting section
2. Verify credentials are correct
3. Check Cursor logs
4. Ensure HTTP server is running during OAuth flow
5. Verify OwnerRez hasn't blocked your IP
